# Umbraco Installation Guide (macOS with M3 Chip)

This guide walks you through setting up Umbraco on your macOS machine using .NET without Docker. Ideal for initial development and local testing.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

- macOS with M3 chip
- [Install .NET SDK (v8 or newer)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
  - Make sure to download the **ARM64 version** for M1/M2/M3 Macs.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Terminal access

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Verify .NET Installation

Open terminal and run:

```bash
dotnet --info

You should see info about the installed .NET SDK.

‚∏ª

2. Install Umbraco Templates

dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates

This adds the latest Umbraco templates to your .NET SDK.

‚∏ª

3. Create a New Project

dotnet new umbraco -n MyProject
cd MyProject

	‚Ä¢	Replace MyProject with your desired folder name.
	‚Ä¢	A .csproj file should be generated inside.

‚∏ª

4. Trust the Development HTTPS Certificate

To fix the HTTPS error on macOS:

dotnet dev-certs https --trust



‚∏ª

5. Run Umbraco

dotnet run

After a few seconds, the terminal will show:

Now listening on: https://localhost:443xx

Copy this URL and open it in your browser. You‚Äôll see the Install Umbraco screen üéâ

‚∏ª

üóÑ Database Options

Since you are not using Docker or SQL Server yet, Umbraco will use SQLite by default.

This is great for:
	‚Ä¢	Local dev
	‚Ä¢	Fast setup
	‚Ä¢	No config needed

You can always switch to SQL Server later (see the Docker setup below).

‚∏ª

üê≥ Planning to Use Docker + SQL Server?

If you want to set up Docker for Umbraco + Microsoft SQL Server later, follow the next steps in a separate guide (README-docker.md). This setup is perfect when:
	‚Ä¢	You need SQL Server features
	‚Ä¢	Preparing for production
	‚Ä¢	Collaborating with others
